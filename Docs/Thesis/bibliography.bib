    abstract={Have open-source network topology emulators out-grown the realm of academic and educational playgrounds? We tackle with that question by dissecting our experiences with preproduction testing of functional blocks implemented in commercial carrier-grade telco equipment, which we performed in a testbed based on open-source tools. As the concepts and mechanisms on which popular network emulation platforms are based vary, so does their applicability to different problem domains in telco product testing. Our survey of the existing open-source tools reveals that the spectrum of their features and limitations is multidimensional, with the choice of virtualization techniques applied being crucial to the raw packet processing throughput, topology size scaling, experiment instantiation speeds, and the flexibility of integrating diverse tools in a single testbed environment. We measured key performance metrics for two conceptually similar emulation platforms (IMUNES and CORE) running on different operating systems (FreeBSD and Linux). Three testbed scenarios for commercial telecommunication products were described and analyzed.},

    abstract = "In this paper we perform a detailed statistical analysis of \{IP\} traffic at flow level, based on data traces collected on the France Telecom wide area \{IP\} network. We particularly focus on the assessment of assumptions commonly used in flow level performance models, i. e. Poisson flow arrival process, both for \{UDP\} and \{TCP\} traffic. We first discuss the concept of flow and present a method to estimate an adequate Time Out value to distinguish different flows within a traffic stream. To model the flow arrival process, we find that Gamma and Weibull distributions provide excellent fits to the empirical flow inter-arrival time distributions. In addition, a fairly low level of correlation is detected between successive flow arrivals. Flow size distributions, though more difficult to model due to their composite aspect, show a very well marked heavy-tailed character of the Pareto type. We found that these results were very consistent among all the data traces we analyzed."

    abstract="Methods are developed for finding properties of the output of linear and nonlinear dynamic systems to random actions represented by Poisson white noise and filtered Poisson processes. The Poisson white noise can be viewed as a sequence of independent, identically distributed pulses arriving at random times. The filtered Poisson process is the output of a linear filter to Poisson white noise. Three methods are considered for finding output properties. If the input has infrequent or frequent pulses, output properties can be obtained from a Markov model or the assumption that the input is a Gaussian white noise, respectively. Otherwise, a method based on It{\^o}'s formula for semimartingales is used to find output properties. Examples are used to illustrate the proposed methods.",
