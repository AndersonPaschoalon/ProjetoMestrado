\section{Open-source and free traffic generator tools}


In this section we will presented a short review of many open-source tools available for synthetic traffic generation and benchmark. The goal in this section is to present both the most mentioned tools in the literature, and the most recent and advanced ones. On table~\ref{tab:trafficgen-list1} is presented a short review of some of the main features of such tools, such as support for Operational systems, protocols, stochastic functions available for traffic generation, available interfaces, and traffic generator class. Some free, but not open-source traffic generators are listed as well. 

Before present our survey, we will refer to some tools mentioned in literature, but we couldn't found source code and manual. \textbf{BRUNO}\cite{bruno-paper} is traffic generator implemented aiming performance and accuracy on timings. It has many configurable parameters that allow emulation of many web server scenarios. \textbf{Divide and conquer}\cite{validate-trafficgen}: Divide and conquer is replay engine that works in a distributed manner. It is able to split traces among multiple commodity PCs, and reply packets, to produce realistic traffic. Some others mentioned tools\cite{web-ditg} we weren't able to find any reference of available features are: \textbf{UDPgen}, \textbf{Network Traffic Generator}, \textbf{Packet Shell}, \textbf{Real-Time Voice Traffic Generator}, \textbf{PIM-SM Protocol Independent Multicast Packet Generator}, \textbf{TTCP}, \textbf{SPAK, Packet Generator}, \textbf{TfGen}, \textbf{TrafGen} and \textbf{Mtools}.
