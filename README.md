# SIMITAR master degree's project

SIMITAR (SniffIng, ModellIng, and TrAffic geneRation) is a tool for flow-based
realistic traffic generation. 

It is able to create a traffic model based on its observation (from a live 
capture or pcap file), and generate traffic using almost any packet generator
tool (low level C APIs such as libtins, traffic generator tools such Iperf).
Currently it is supporting:
* Iperf
* D-ITG
* Libtins (C++ API)
